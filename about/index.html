            I was born in 1976 in Erzurum, Turkey. I graduated from Anadolu
            University, Faculty of Business Administration, Department of
            Business Administration. I have worked as an accountant and
            accounting manager in various countries since 1996. I have worked in
            a total of 24.5 years, including 10 years in Afghanistan, 2.5 years
            in Somalia, 6 years in Iraq and 6 years in Istanbul. I have been
            living in Switzerland since 2021. I chose a new industry in
            Switzerland and decided to become a software engineer. I am
            currently taking a FullStack course from a course called Hi Coders.
            After completing the course, I intend to work in the IT sector.
