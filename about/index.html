        <h1 class="h1">About</h1>
        <p class="p">
          I was born in 1976 in Erzurum, Turkey. I graduated from Anadolu
          University, Faculty of Business Administration, majoring in Business
          Administration. Commencing my career as an accountant, I progressed to
          roles of greater responsibility, eventually assuming the position of
          accounting manager. Throughout my career spanning since 1996, I've had
          the opportunity to work in various countries. I dedicated a decade of
          my career to Afghanistan, followed by 2.5 years in Somalia, and then 6
          years in Iraq. Subsequently, I spent 6 years in Istanbul. My journey
          led me to Switzerland in 2021, where I embarked on a new path in the
          tech industry, pivoting towards becoming a software engineer. To equip
          myself with the requisite skills, I undertook a FullStack course at Hi
          Coders. This transition represents a significant shift, reflecting my
          dedication to mastering a new field and adapting to the evolving
          landscape of technology.

        <p class="p">
            45 years old, I learned a new language and
          profession. I am determined when it comes to learning. I am aware that
          I need to continue my life by constantly learning new things.
